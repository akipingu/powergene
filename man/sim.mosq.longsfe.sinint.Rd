\title{Simulate Mosquito Count Data for Long-Term Semi-Field Experiment Testing Single Intervention}
\usage{
sim.mosq.longsfe.sinint(
  n.ch.per.trt,
  exp.length,
  sampl.freq = "weekly",
  lambda,
  intvn.effect,
  chamber.var,
  time.var,
  theta,
  use.random = "ALL"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n.ch.per.trt}{An integer specifying the number of chambers allocated per treatment group.}

\item{exp.length}{An integer indicating total duration of the experiment in days, e.g., 90 days.}

\item{sampl.freq}{A character for a sampling frequency label. Example, for 90 days experiment; `"daily"` means 90 sampling points, `"weekly"` means 12 sampling points, `"biweekly"` means 6 sampling points, or `"monthly"` means 3 sampling points.}

\item{lambda}{A numeric value indicating the expected mean mosquito count in control chambers.}

\item{intvn.effect}{A numeric value representing the proportional reduction in mosquito count due to the intervention (e.g., ITN).}

\item{chamber.var}{A numeric value specifying the variance of random chamber-level effects.}

\item{time.var}{A numeric value indicating the variance between sampling time points (random effect).}

\item{theta}{A numeric value quantifying overdispersion parameter for the negative binomial distribution.}

\item{use.random}{A logical value indicating whether to return mosquito counts simulated through a sampling distribution (with random or fixed chamber effects) or all.
If \code{TRUE}, returns expected mosquito counts simulated through sampling distribution with random effects;
If \code{FALSE}, returns expected mosquito counts simulated through sampling distribution based on fixed effects only;
If \code{NULL}, returns expected mosquito counts simulated through exponential function based on fixed effects (no sampling distribution);
If \code{"ALL"}, returns the full data set with all mosquito count columns based in all three options described above.}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns:
\describe{
  \item{replicates}{Replicate number within each treatment group (e.g., for a total of 2 chambers per treatment means 1, 2 replicates per treatment)}
  \item{intvn}{Intervention status (e.g., 0 = control or no intervention and 1 = there is intervention)}
  \item{chamber}{Unique chamber identifier as a factor (e.g., 0-1, 0-2 for the control chambers and 1-1, 1-2 for intervention chambers)}
  \item{time}{Time sequence scaled between 0 and 1, it is calculate by the ratio of sampling points by their total number}
  \item{timef}{This is just the same as "time" but as a factor}
  \item{intvn.time}{This is the interaction between an intervention and time, i.e., intvn x time}
  \item{lin.pred.fixed}{Linear predictor with fixed effects only}
  \item{lin.pred.random}{Linear predictor with random chamber effects}
  \item{mosquito.count.fixed.exp}{Simulted mosquito counts through exponetial function from fixed effects only (no sampling)}
  \item{mosquito.count.fixed}{Simulated mosquito counts through sampling distribution based on fixed effects only}
  \item{mosquito.count.random}{Simulated mosquito counts through sampling distribution accounting for random effects}
}
}
\description{
Generates simulated mosquito count data under a short-term semi-field experimental design
with fixed effects for intervention ('intvn'), random effects for chambers and sampling time points variability, and a negative binomial distributed outcomes.
Uses output from `sim.scen.longsfe.sinint()` to incorporate the table of experimental design scenarios.
