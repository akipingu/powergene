\title{Simulate Design Scenarios for Short-Term Semi-Field Experiment Testing Combined Interventions}
\usage{
sim.scen.shortsfe.comint(n.ch.per.trt)
}
\arguments{
\item{n.ch.per.trt}{An integer specifying the number of chambers allocated per treatment group.}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns:
\describe{
  \item{replicates}{Replicate number within each treatment group (e.g., for a total of 2 chambers per treatment means 1, 2 replicates per treatment)}
  \item{intvn1}{Intervention status (e.g., 0 = control or no intervention 1 and 1 = there is intervention 1)}
  \item{intvn2}{Intervention status (e.g., 0 = control or no intervention 2 and 1 = there is intervention 2)}
  \item{ixn}{Interventions interactions status (e.g., 0 = control or no intervention and 1 = there is interaction)}
  \item{chamber}{Unique chamber identifier as a factor (e.g., 0-0-1, 0-0-2 for the control chambers and 0-1-1, 1-0-1, 1-1-1 for intervention chambers)}
}
}
\description{
Constructs a data frame representing the factorial design of semi-field experiments
testing intvn1 and intvn2 interventions. Each chamber is uniquely identified and assigned
treatments combinations, including interaction terms.
