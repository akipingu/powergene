\title{Extract p-value from Simulated GLMM for Long-Term Semi-Field Experiment Testing Combined Interventions}
\usage{
sim.pval.longsfe.comint(
  n.ch.per.trt,
  exp.length,
  sampl.freq = "weekly",
  lambda,
  intvn1.effect,
  intvn2.effect,
  ixn.effect,
  chamber.var,
  time.var,
  theta,
  use.random = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n.ch.per.trt}{An integer specifying the number of chambers allocated per treatment group.}

\item{exp.length}{An integer indicating total duration of the experiment in days, e.g., 90 days.}

\item{sampl.freq}{A character for a sampling frequency label. Example, for 90 days experiment; `"daily"` means 90 sampling points, `"weekly"` means 12 sampling points, `"biweekly"` means 6 sampling points, or `"monthly"` means 3 sampling points.}

\item{lambda}{A numeric value indicating the expected mean mosquito count in control chambers.}

\item{intvn1.effect}{A numeric value representing the proportional reduction in mosquito count due to the intervention 1 (e.g., ITN).}

\item{intvn2.effect}{A numeric value representing the proportional reduction in mosquito count due to the intervention 2 (PPFa).}

\item{ixn.effect}{A numeric value representing the proportional reduction in mosquito count due to the interaction between interventions (e.g., ITN x PPFa).}

\item{chamber.var}{A numeric value specifying the variance of random chamber-level effects.}

\item{time.var}{A numeric value indicating the variance between sampling time points (random effect).}

\item{theta}{A numeric value quantifying overdispersion parameter for the negative binomial distribution.}

\item{use.random}{A logical value indicating whether to return mosquito counts simulated through a sampling distribution (with random or fixed chamber effects) or all.
If \code{TRUE}, returns expected mosquito counts simulated through sampling distribution with random effects;
If \code{FALSE}, returns expected mosquito counts simulated through sampling distribution based on fixed effects only;}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector:
\describe{
  \item{pvalue}{A p-value from likelihood ratio test comparing models with and without the interaction term}
}
}
\description{
Returns the p-value by fitting a negative binomial GLMM to simulated mosquito count data.
Uses simulated mosquito counts data from `sim.mosq.longsfe.comint()` and fits a negative binomial GLMM to extract the p-value associated with the intvn effect.
