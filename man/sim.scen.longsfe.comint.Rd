\title{Simulate Design Scenarios for Long-Term Semi-Filed Experiment Testing Combined Interventions}
\usage{
sim.scen.longsfe.comint(n.ch.per.trt, exp.length, sampl.freq = "weekly")
}
\arguments{
\item{n.ch.per.trt}{An integer specifying the number of chambers allocated per treatment group.}

\item{exp.length}{An integer indicating total duration of the experiment in days, e.g., 90 days.}

\item{sampl.freq}{A character for a sampling frequency label. Example, for 90 days experiment; `"daily"` means 90 sampling points, `"weekly"` means 12 sampling points, `"biweekly"` means 6 sampling points, or `"monthly"` means 3 sampling points.}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns:
\describe{
  \item{replicates}{Replicate number within each treatment group (e.g., for a total of 2 chambers per treatment means 1, 2 replicates per treatment)}
  \item{intvn1}{Intervention status (e.g., 0 = control or no intervention 1 and 1 = there is intervention 1)}
  \item{intvn2}{Intervention status (e.g., 0 = control or no intervention 2 and 1 = there is intervention 2)}
  \item{chamber}{Unique chamber identifier as a factor (e.g., 0-0-1, 0-0-2 for the control chambers and 0-1-1, 1-0-1, 1-1-1 for intervention chambers)}
  \item{time}{Time sequence scaled between 0 and 1, it is calculate by the ratio of sampling points by their total number}
  \item{timef}{This is just the same as "time" but as a factor}
  \item{ixn.intvn1.time}{This is the interaction between an intvn1 and time, i.e., intvn1 x time}
  \item{ixn.intvn2.time}{This is the interaction between an intvn2 and time, i.e., intvn2 x time}
  \item{ixn.intvn1.intvn2.time}{This is the interaction between an intvn1, intvn2 and time, i.e., intvn1 x intvn2 x time}
}
}
\description{
Constructs a data frame representing the factorial design of semi-field experiments
testing combined interventions. Each chamber is uniquely identified and assigned
treatments combinations, including interaction terms. The intervention here are shortly named as `intvn1` and `intvn2`.
