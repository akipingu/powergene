#  powergene: A simulation-based power analysis R Package to aid the design of robust semi-field vector control experiments

This R package simulates mosquito count data under short-term semi-field experimental designs, incorporating fixed treatment effects and random chamber variability. Itâ€™s built for pragmatic trial planning, MSc-level teaching, and reproducible research workflows.

## Installation

Install directly from GitHub:
  
  ```r
# install.packages("devtools") if not already installed
devtools::install_github("akipingu/powergene")
#load library
library(powergene)
```

Simulate mosquitoes
```r
# Simulate mosquito counts with:
# - 4 chambers per treatment group
# - Baseline lambda = 50
# - 80% intervention effect (e.g., ITN)
# - Chamber-level variance = 0.1807

sim.data <- sim.mosq.shortsfe.sinint(
  n.ch.per.trt = 4,
  lambda = 50,
  interv.effect = 0.8,
  chamber.var = 0.1807
)

head(sim.data)
```
