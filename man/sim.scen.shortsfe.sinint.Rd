\title{Simulate Design Scenarios for Short-Term Semi-Field Experiment Testing Single Intervention}
\usage{
sim.scen.shortsfe.sinint(n.ch.per.trt)
}
\arguments{
\item{n.ch.per.trt}{An integer specifying the number of chambers allocated per treatment group.}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns:
\describe{
  \item{replicates}{Replicate number within each treatment group (e.g., for a total of 2 chambers per treatment means 1, 2 replicates per treatment)}
  \item{intvn}{Intervention status (e.g., 0 = control or no intervention and 1 = there is intervention)}
  \item{chamber}{Unique chamber identifier as a factor (e.g., 0-1, 0-2 for the control chambers and 1-1, 1-2 for intervention chambers)}
}
}
\description{
Constructs a design scenario table representing a short-term semi-field experiment
with two treatment levels (or intervention status), i.e., control (no intervention) and intervention, and a specified number of chambers or compartment per treatment.
Each chamber is uniquely identified by a treatment level and a replicate combination. An intervention here is shortly named as `intvn`.
}
\details{
This function considers a single design parameter, which is
the total number of chambers or compartments per treatment (`n.ch.per.trt`), e.g., 4.
The `n.ch.per.trt` indicates how many chambers known as `replicates` are present per treatment.
}
\examples{
sim.scen.shortsfe.sinint(n.ch.per.trt = 4)
