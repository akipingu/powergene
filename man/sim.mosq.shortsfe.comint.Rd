\title{Simulate Mosquito Count Data for Short-Term Semi-Field Experiment Testing Combined Interventions}
\usage{
sim.mosq.shortsfe.comint(
  n.ch.per.trt,
  lambda,
  intvn1.effect,
  intvn2.effect,
  ixn.effect,
  chamber.var,
  use.random = "ALL"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n.ch.per.trt}{An integer specifying the number of chambers allocated per treatment group.}

\item{lambda}{A numeric value indicating the expected mean mosquito count in control chambers.}

\item{intvn1.effect}{A numeric value representing the proportional reduction in mosquito count due to the intervention 1 (e.g., ITN).}

\item{intvn2.effect}{A numeric value representing the proportional reduction in mosquito count due to the intervention 2 (e.g., PPFa).}

\item{ixn.effect}{A numeric value representing the proportional reduction in mosquito count due to the interaction (e.g., ITN x PPFa).}

\item{chamber.var}{A numeric value specifying the variance of random chamber-level effects.}

\item{use.random}{A logical value indicating whether to return mosquito counts simulated through a sampling distribution (with random or fixed chamber effects) or all.
If \code{TRUE}, returns expected mosquito counts simulated through sampling distribution with random effects;
If \code{FALSE}, returns expected mosquito counts simulated through sampling distribution based on fixed effects only;
If \code{NULL}, returns expected mosquito counts simulated through exponential function based on fixed effects (no sampling distribution);
If \code{"ALL"}, returns the full data set with all mosquito count columns based in all three options described above.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns, depending on the \code{use.random} option:
\describe{
  \item{replicates}{Replicate number within each treatment group (e.g., for a total of 2 chambers per treatment means 1, 2 replicates per treatment)}
  \item{intvn1}{Intervention status (e.g., 0 = control or no intervention 1 and 1 = there is intervention 1)}
  \item{intvn2}{Intervention status (e.g., 0 = control or no intervention 2 and 1 = there is intervention 2)}
  \item{ixn}{Interventions interactions status (e.g., 0 = control or no intervention and 1 = there is interaction)}
  \item{chamber}{Unique chamber identifier as a factor (e.g., 0-0-1, 0-0-2 for the control chambers and 0-1-1, 1-0-1, 1-1-1 for intervention chambers)}
  \item{lin.pred.fixed}{Linear predictor with fixed effects only}
  \item{lin.pred.random}{Linear predictor with random chamber effects}
  \item{mosquito.count.fixed.exp}{Simulted mosquito counts through exponetial function from fixed effects only (no sampling)}
  \item{mosquito.count.fixed}{Simulated mosquito counts through sampling distribution based on fixed effects only}
  \item{mosquito.count.random}{Simulated mosquito counts through sampling distribution accounting for random effects}
}
}
\description{
Generates simulated mosquito count data under a short-term semi-field experimental design
with fixed effects for interventions, `intvn1` and `intvn2`, random effects for chamber variability, and Poisson-distributed outcomes.
Uses output from `sim.scen.shortsfe.comint()` to incorporate the table of experimental design scenarios.
