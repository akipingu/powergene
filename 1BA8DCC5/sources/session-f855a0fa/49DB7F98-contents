# powergene: A simulation-based power analysis R Package to aid the design of robust semi-field vector control experiments

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

This R package simulates mosquito count data under short-term semi-field experimental designs, incorporating fixed treatment effects and random chamber variability. Itâ€™s built for pragmatic trial planning, MSc-level teaching, and reproducible research workflows.

## Installation

You can install the development version of powergene directly from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:


  ```r
# install.packages("devtools") if not already installed
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("akipingu/powergene")
#load library
library(powergene)
```


## Example: Estimating power of a short-term SFE testing single intervention

This is a basic example which shows you how to apply the powergene package to estimate power of a short-term SFE

Simulate mosquitoes
```r
# Simulate mosquito counts with:
# - 4 chambers per treatment group
# - Baseline lambda = 50
# - 80% intervention effect (e.g., ITN)
# - Chamber-level variance = 0.1807

sim.mosquitoes <- sim.mosq.shortsfe.sinint(
  n.ch.per.trt = 4,
  lambda = 50,
  interv.effect = 0.8,
  chamber.var = 0.1807
)

head(sim.mosquitoes)
```
